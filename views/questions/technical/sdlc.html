            More technical interview questions
        </a>
        <a name="Section1">What is software process or Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?</a>
        <p>
            Software Development Life Cycle, or software process is the systematic development of software by following every stage in
            the development process namely, Requirement Gathering, System Analysis, Design, Coding, Testing, Maintenance
            and Documentation in that order.
        </p>
        <a name="Section2">What are SDLC models available?</a>
        <p>There are several SDLC models available such as Waterfall Model, Iterative Model, Spiral model, V-model and Big-bang
            Model etc.</p>
        <a name="Section3">What are various phases of SDLC?</p>
        <p>
            The generic phases of SDLC are: Requirement Gathering, System Analysis and Design, Coding, Testing and implementation. The
            phases depend upon the model we choose to develop software.
        </p>
        <a name="Section4">Which SDLC model is the best?</a>
        <p>
            SDLC Models are adopted as per requirements of development process. It may very software-to-software to ensuring which model
            is suitable.

            <p>We can select the best SDLC model if following answers are satisfied -</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is SDLC suitable for selected technology to implement the software ?</li>
                <li>Is SDLC appropriate for clientâ€™s requirements and priorities ?</li>
                <li>Is SDLC model suitable for size and complexity of the software ?</li>
                <li>Is the SDLC model suitable for type of projects and engineering we do ?</li>
                <li>Is the SDLC appropriate for the geographically co-located or dispersed developers ?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
