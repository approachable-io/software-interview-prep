# Text Editor Explanation

VS CODE!?!?! Flame war commence!!!! I know, I know. There are a million different options here, and we can argue forever about the "Best" editor (spoiler: There isn't one), but we're making the call here to use Visual Studio Code because:

- it is relatively lightweight (Unlike full Visual Studio)
- it is approachable and familiar to most computer users (unlike Vim)
- it is free (unlike Sublime or Webstorm)
- it has support for git functionality (unlike Notepad++) - Here we can get into a separate debate about learning all git commands from the command line right away, but remember, approachablity always wins here, and teaching yet another interface (especially one as intimidating as the command line) is not preferable

If you're comfortable with something else, feel free to use something else, but here, we are making this decision under the "Approachability Guideline" of "sacrifice development speed, performance, and productivity every time if it makes the code easier for those with less technical expertise to participate in the project." The easiest thing here is to just pick one and not present first-time contributors an overwhelming number of options that could paralyze them. 

If you would like to rewrite this section in another free, simple, light-weight IDE (like Atom) we would be willing to include it as supplemental material.

All of that said, as much as possible, Approachable IO attempts to be editor agnostic, and we are open to feedback.
