# Contributing to Approachable IO

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our projects.  If this is one of your first contributions, welcome to the open source community!

## What is an Approachable Open Source Project
### An Approachable Open Source project will:

- allow those who are interested and committed, regardless of skill level, contribute to the project.
- have at least one approachable issue that can be worked on without end and a guide for how to work on the issue so that a newcomer can always feel comfortable making their first pull request. We call this the `Infinitely Approachable Issue`. An excellent example of this can be found in the [getting-started](https://github.com/approachable-io/getting-started#getting-started) repository.

Every project has tradeoffs, and that is OK as long as we're on the same page. An Approachable Open Source project will often:

- sacrifice development speed, performance, and productivity every time if it makes the code easier for those with less technical expertise to participate in the project.
- Write Everything Twice `WET` instead of following the coding standard of Don't Repeat Yourself `DRY`.
Of course, `DRY` code written at a fast pace is still preferable to `WET` code written at a slow pace, but not at the cost of making a project less approachable. 

The bottom line is simple: If you would like to add to our project, please do!  Don't be afraid to get a little `WET`!

## Code of Conduct
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Please be mindful that contributions to our projects come from people with varying levels of skill.

## How can I contribute
The goal of Approachable IO is to create projects that allow developers of all experience levels to contribute to the project. Contributing to open source projects can be an intimidating endeavor, and Approachable IO is aiming to lower the complexity for those who wish to contribute to open source projects.

Some quick examples:
- Typos and Document updates
- Following Tutorials on projects to help get your first Pull Requests in
- Proposing new projects or features

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Approachable IO? You can try out our [getting-started](https://github.com/approachable-io/getting-started#getting-started) project to go from no account to your first pull request.

You can also take a look at our [issues](https://github.com/approachable-io/software-interview-prep) for either of the following labels to find a good start.

- `good first issue` labels are great for first time contributions with little to no code knowledge necessary
- `help wanted issues` labels are good for collaborative talk on implementation or possible guidance needed 

## Submitting an Issue

If you find a typo, broken link, or simply want to suggest a feature, you can use GitHub's Issues. For help submitting an issue you can view GitHub's [quick article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on creating an issue.

## What to include in issues
We have created an [issue template](../docs/issue_template.md) that should guide you with a few quick questions to start the issue.  You can add more or less information as long as you feel it covers the topic you are reporting.

## What to include in pull requests
Like our issue template, we have a [pull request template](../docs/pull_request_template.md) to help make sure each pull request is descriptive of the changes being made.  This is not a required document to fill out.  Instead the template is to help remind contributors to describe all changes made to help reviewers make quick merges of each pull request.
